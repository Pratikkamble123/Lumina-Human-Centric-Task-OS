# 🌟 Lumina — Human-Centric Task Management System

Lumina is a modern, human-centric task management application built to help individuals and teams organize work with clarity and focus.
It follows a **Kanban-style workflow** and emphasizes clean UI, smooth interactions, and productivity-driven design.

This project was built as part of my portfolio to showcase my skills in **frontend development, state management, and user-focused UI design**.

## 🚀 Features

* 🧩 Kanban board with Todo, In Progress, Review, and Done columns
* 🎯 Task priorities (Urgent, High, Medium) and tag-based filtering
* 🔍 Global search and tag filters
* 🌗 Dark / Light mode support
* 📋 Multiple views: Board, List, Calendar (planned), Insights
* ⚡ Fast, responsive, and clean UI
* 🧠 Human-centric design focused on usability and clarity


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React + TypeScript
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **State Management:** Zustand
* **Build Tool:** Vite

> Currently uses local state persistence. Designed to be easily extended with a backend (Prisma, PostgreSQL, authentication, etc.).

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I wanted to build more than just a basic CRUD application.
Lumina focuses on **product-level UI**, real-world usability, and thoughtful interactions.

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

* Component-driven architecture
* State management with Zustand
* Theme handling (Dark / Light mode)
* Scalable UI patterns


## 🔮 Future Improvements

* User authentication
* Backend integration (Prisma + PostgreSQL)
* Real-time collaboration
* Drag-and-drop task movement
* Productivity analytics and insights
